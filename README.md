A simple application built with React that generates random advice slips by fetching data from the Advice Slip API. This project is a great example of how to handle asynchronous API requests, manage state, and deal with side effects in a modern React application using hooks.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Generate New Advice**: Click the dice button to fetch a new piece of advice.
-   **Loading State**: Displays a loading message while fetching data, improving user experience.
-   **Disabled Button**: The button is temporarily disabled during an API call to prevent multiple simultaneous requests.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

-   **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   **React Hooks**:
    -   `useState`: For managing component state (advice data, loading status).
    -   `useEffect`: For handling side effects, like fetching initial data.
    -   `useCallback`: For memoizing functions and optimizing performance.
-   **Advice Slip API**: A free, simple API for generating random advice.
-   **HTML5 & CSS3**: For structure and styling.
-   **Fetch API**: For making network requests to the API.
